# SVD Image Compression notebook--
Singular value decomposition has applications in image compression. 
Here I'll showcase some of the tools for manipulating images in python. 
The key here is that a black and white image is just a matrix where the numbers represent the intensity of a given pixel,
which can be decomposed just like any other.

t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (tSNE) is a Machine Learning non-linear dimensionality reduction technique.

Perplexity- Defines balance between local and global aspects of your data. No. of points we want to preserve in local neighbourhood.

We should always run the algo for various value’s of perplexity.
If perplexity is large, clusters will tend to shrink into denser structures
